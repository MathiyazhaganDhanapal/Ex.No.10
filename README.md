## Date: 22.11.2025
## Reg. No: 212223050028

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:

## Prompt Patterns Introduced:

<img width="1050" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b68a90-ce41-40e9-a79f-7a9761156d32" />

## Selected Content Scenarios : 

### We’ll demonstrate two scenarios:

Educational Report on Renewable Energy (Structured + Factual)
Creative Case Study – Smart City Traffic System (Innovative + Practical)
## Stage 1: Basic Prompt (Raw Generation)
### Example 1: Educational Report
## Prompt:
“Write a report on renewable energy.”

## Output (Basic):
Renewable energy comes from natural sources like sunlight, wind, and water. It is important because it helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gases. There are many types like solar, wind, and hydro power.

## Evaluation:
Simple but lacks structure, analysis, and professional tone.

Example 2: Creative Case Study
## Prompt:
“Write a short case study about a city that uses technology to reduce traffic problems.”

## Output (Basic):
A city used cameras and sensors to detect congestion and control traffic lights. It helped reduce jams and accidents.

## Evaluation:
Good idea, but lacks depth, analysis, and real-world context.

Stage 2: Query Decomposition + Answer Engineering
Educational Report (Refined)
## Prompt:
“Write a 3-section educational report on renewable energy with:

Introduction
Types of Renewable Energy
Benefits and Future Scope.”
## Output:
## Introduction:
Renewable energy refers to power derived from resources that naturally replenish, such as sunlight, wind, and water.

## Types:

Solar Power: Uses photovoltaic cells.
Wind Power: Converts wind into electricity via turbines.
Hydropower: Generates electricity from moving water.
## Benefits & Future:
Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Innovations in energy storage and smart grids are improving efficiency and adoption.

## Result:
Better structure and educational tone achieved.

Creative Case Study (Refined)
## Prompt:
“Write a 3-section creative case study on a Smart City Traffic System using AI and IoT for ambulance priority management. End with outcomes and future potential.”

## Output:
## Background:
Urban traffic congestion delays emergency vehicles, causing loss of lives. The Smart City of NovaGrid implemented an AI-driven traffic system to prioritize ambulances.

## Implementation:
IoT sensors and GPS modules detect ambulances approaching intersections. Traffic lights switch to a ‘priority signal mode,’ ensuring a clear route. Data is simultaneously shared with hospitals via cloud servers.

## Outcomes:
Response times reduced by 40%. Hospitals receive real-time updates, enabling faster emergency care. The system will expand to integrate drones and satellite-based monitoring for broader coverage.

## Result:
Demonstrates structured, practical innovation aligned with smart city goals.

## Stage 3: Decision Making + Semantic Filtering
Educational Report – Decision Prompt
## Prompt:
“Choose the most promising renewable energy for India between solar, wind, and hydro — justify your choice with facts, benefits, and challenges. Write in a formal academic tone.”

## Output:
Chosen Source: Solar Energy
India receives over 300 sunny days annually, making solar energy the most viable renewable source.

## Benefits: Abundant sunlight, scalability, and declining photovoltaic costs.
Challenges: Energy storage and land requirements.

## Conclusion: Continued investment in solar parks and microgrid systems can ensure sustainable growth.

Creative Case Study – Tone Filtered
## Prompt:
“Rewrite the Smart City Traffic System case study in a formal, futuristic tone suitable for a government innovation report.”

## Output:
The NovaGrid Smart City Initiative integrates AI and IoT to manage emergency traffic flow. A network of sensors identifies ambulances and automatically reconfigures signal priorities.
The system demonstrates the feasibility of intelligent mobility infrastructure. With advancements in vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, cities can achieve near-zero emergency response delay by 2030.

## Result:
Professional and policy-ready tone achieved using semantic filtering.

## Stage 4: Tail Generation (Depth Extension)
## Prompt:
“Extend the renewable energy report with a section describing how AI and IoT will transform energy management in the next decade.”

## Output:
## Future Prediction:
AI-driven smart grids and IoT-enabled monitoring systems will optimize power usage in real-time. Predictive analytics will balance load demand, minimize waste, and improve storage efficiency.
By 2035, decentralized energy systems will empower households to produce and share energy seamlessly.

## Stage 5: Fact Checklist Verification
## Prompt:
“List 3 verified facts about renewable energy adoption worldwide with sources.”

## Output:

As of 2024, renewable sources supply 30% of global electricity (IEA, 2024).
China leads in solar capacity with over 400 GW installed (World Energy Council).
India’s solar capacity surpassed 70 GW as of 2024 (MNRE Report, Govt. of India).
Stage 6: Menu Actions (Interactive Refinement)
## Prompt:
“We have 3 ways to improve the renewable energy report. Choose the best one and proceed:

Add a global comparison chart.
Add an executive summary.
Add a conclusion with policy recommendations.”
## Output:
Choice Selected: 3. Policy Recommendations

## Conclusion:
Governments should incentivize private investments, promote domestic solar manufacturing, and integrate AI-based energy management for nationwide sustainability.

## Deliverables Summary:
